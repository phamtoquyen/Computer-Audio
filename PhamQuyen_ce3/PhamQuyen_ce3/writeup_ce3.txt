For this excercise, I recored 2 GPS instructions using my phone. Next, I chose a pieces of piano music from 
https://freesound.org. Then, I normalized the audio files for a consistent volume profile.

Ducking seemed to work best with a duck gain that gradually tapers off in .5 seconds. I reduced the duck gain from 1.0 to .3 in this timeframe.
I reduced the duck gain from 1.0 to .3 in this timeframe.Then, when the GPS voice played, the background music frequencies will be cutoff by 500 Hz

Topological view of the UGens:

BACKGROUND MUSIC --> BIQUAD FILTER --> MUSIC GAIN --> GAIN -> AC OUT
