Class Exercise 4:

The code is the simulation of an audio tape reel-to-reel visualization, which uses the Beads library and ControlP5 library to create a UI and handle audio processing. 
The code uses a combination of Glide objects, SamplePlayer objects, and Bead objects to handle audio playback, rate control, and end-of-sample handling. The UI consists of five buttons: 
Play, Rewind, Stop, Fast Forward, and Reset. When a button is clicked, it's corresponding sound effect is fired. The functionality of those buttons is as below:

    Play - Resumes normal speed playback from current position of sound file.
    Stop - Stops playback of the sound file, maintaining the current playback position. Playback can resume from the same point after hitting the play button
    Reset - Stops playback and resets playhead to beginning of music.
    Rewind - Sets playback to -4.0 rate and begins playback.
    Fast Forward - starts playback from the current position of the sound file at an increased speed of 4.0 rate

Also, The Play, Fast Forward, and Rewind buttons modify the playback rate of the music sample using a Glide object, while the Stop and Reset buttons start 
the corresponding audio samples. The code also includes a listener to handle the end of the sample and reset the playback rate to 0.
