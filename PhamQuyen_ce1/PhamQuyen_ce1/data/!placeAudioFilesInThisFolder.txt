2/ UGen: The UGEN using before the Gain object (which is used to modify the volume of the sound) is Reverb, more specifically damping. 
Damping refers to the absorption of sound by the surfaces of a room. The damping parameter controls the amount of high frequency content 
that is absorbed by the surfaces of the room. A higher damping value results in less high frequency content in the reverb, making the reverb sound drier,
and the value of damping is in between 0 - 1.
3/How the UI control modifies its value(s): The DampingTime slider is in the range of 0 to 1. And, the function DampingTime(float value) will take in 
in a value on the dampingTime slider. Then, the reverb object damping value will be set to the value based on the damplingTime slider.
